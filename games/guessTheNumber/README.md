# Guess the Number Game
A simple web-based game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a set range. 
The player has a limited number of attempts to find the correct answer, with feedback provided after each guess.

## Project Overview
The "Guess the Number" game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 attempts to guess it.
After each guess, the player receives hints to help narrow down the answer. The game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.

## Features
- Responsive design using CSS Flexbox.
- Hints provided for each guess: "Too High" or "Too Low".
- Game reset functionality with a "Play Again" button.
- Styled UI for a simple and clean user experience.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for a clean design.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including random number generation, attempt tracking, and user feedback.
