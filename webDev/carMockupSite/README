**This is my first school project using JavaScript and gridlayout**
All future designs will use flexbox more than likely.

# BMW E30 Project - School Project
This project is a simple website showcasing the BMW E30 models, with information about the brandâ€™s history, model specifications, and design features. 
It has a basic interactive function: a slideshow on the "About" page. 
This project helped me practice essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in a real-world setting.

## Project Overview
This multi-page website contains:
- Home Page: Brief overview of BMW E30 models.
- Models Page: Detailed table listing various BMW models, their specifications, and key features.
- About Page: Description of a BMW model and an interactive slideshow.
- Resources Page: Links to the resources and images used in the project.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structuring content across multiple pages.
- CSS: Styling the pages with custom colors and layouts, including responsive design for mobile compatibility.
- JavaScript: Basic slideshow functionality on the "About" page, allowing users to view different images.

## Features
1. Responsive Design: The website is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. (Still in the process of learning this more with flexbox)
2. Slideshow on About Page: Users can navigate through a series of images related to the BMW 325i model using arrows, allowing for an interactive browsing experience.
3. Model Table on Models Page: Organized table that displays key details about each BMW model.

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

1. Edit the HTML files in the root directory.
